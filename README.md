Anime Playlist:
Mainly for studying file reading functions in Python. Data structure could have been stored as a list of tuples, (name, status, rating) or I could have created a type for each anime with variables name, status, and rating.

Discord Bot:
Wanted to learn about how discord bots are developed so I made a simple bot that currently does basic commands.
